				registration forms or questionnaires</li>
			<li>enable you to participate in a public consultation or any
				other questionnaire</li>

			EUSurvey are carried out in the public interest. No processing
			operations on personal data falling under article 27 "Prior-Checking

	</li>
	<li>
		<h4>3. Who is responsible for the processing of your data?
			(Controller)</h4>
		<p>Your data is processed under the responsibility of the Head of
			Unit of DIGIT.D.1, Directorate-General for Informatics (DIGIT) of the
			European Commission.</p>
		<p>The DIGIT's Data Protection Coordinator ensures that the
			provisions of the above-mentioned regulation are applied within
			DIGIT.</p>
		<p>
			The <a target="_blank"
				href="https://secure.edps.europa.eu/EDPSWEB/edps/EDPS">European
				Data Protection Supervisor</a> (EDPS) is acting as an independent
			supervisory authority. The EDPS makes sure that all EU institutions
			and bodies respect people's right to privacy when processing their
			personal data.
		</p>
	</li>
	<li>
		<h4>4. What personal data do we collect?</h4>
		<p>This statement only covers the corporate service dimension of
			EUSurvey. EUSurvey will process the personal data only for the
			purposes for which they were transmitted.</p>

		<h5>Identity</h5>
		<p>
			The survey owners (i.e. those who want to create and exploit a
			questionnaire) sign up to EULogin (the EC's Authentication Service).
			Please, read the EULogin own privacy statement for further
			information.<br /> EUSurvey stores the EULogin username as well as
			e-mail addresses of the survey owners such as retrieved from EULogin
			and the European Commission's Central User Database which is stored
			at the Data Centre of the European Commission. The Data Centre of the
			European Commission is bound to comply with Regulation (EU) N°
			2018/1725.
		</p>

		<h5>Other personal data</h5>
		<p>
			In addition to the personal information processed by the EUSurvey
			service itself, there are personal data being used within
			questionnaires, for example in the answers to a survey. Please refer
			to the privacy statement of the relevant questionnaire for further
			information.<br /> User's address might be stored if requested by
			the survey owner. If so, it will be only used for the needs of the
			said survey. It is stored by EUSurvey and is not intended for sharing
			with the survey owners.
		</p>

		<h5>Cookies and local storage</h5>
		<p>The system uses
		<ul>
			<li>session "cookies" in order to ensure communication between
				the client and the server. Therefore, user's browser must be
				configured to accept "cookies". The cookies disappear once the
				session has been terminated.</li>
			<li>local storage to save copies of the inputs of a participant
				to a survey in order to have a backup if the server is not available
				during submission or the user's computer is switched off
				accidentally or any other cause.<br /> The local storage contains
				the IDs of the questions and the draft answers.<br /> Once a
				participant has submitted one's answers successfully to the server
				or has successfully saved a draft on the server, the data is removed
				from the local storage. There is a checkbox above the survey to
				disable the feature (useful if the participant uses a public
				computer).
			</li>
		</ul>
		</p>
	</li>
	<li>
		<h4>5. To whom is your data disclosed?</h4>
		<p>
			Only the staff carrying out the processing of your information, and
			dealing with EUSurvey have access to your data. This includes the
			EUSurvey team (see contact under point IX), the survey owners and
			anyone having been granted access to the questionnaires.<br /> Your
			data might be published through the EUSurvey publication module or
			via another website (for further information, read the privacy
			statement specific to the questionnaire)<br /> The EUSurvey team
			does not transmit any data to parties which are outside these
			recipients and the legal framework mentioned, without prejudice to a
			possible transmission to the bodies in charge of an inspection task
			in accordance with Community legislation, e.g. OLAF, or an
			investigating magistrate. EUSurvey will not share personal data with
			third parties for direct marketing.
		</p>
	</li>
	<li>
		<h4>6. For how long is your data kept?</h4>
		<p>
			Contributors' personal data will remain in the database until the
			results of the questionnaire have been completely analysed or until
			the survey owners have requested their removal.<br /> The cookies
			disappear once the session has been terminated.
