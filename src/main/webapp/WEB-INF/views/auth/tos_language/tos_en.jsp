</h2>
<p>
        As long as you are an EU staff member, your user account remains active

        5. HOW DO WE PROTECT AND SAFEGUARD YOUR PERSONAL DATA?
    </a>
</h1>
<p>
    All personal data are stored on the servers of the European Commission’s
    Data Centre. All processing operations are carried out pursuant to the
    Commission Decision (EU, Euratom) 2017/46 of 10 January 2017 on the
    security of communication and information systems in the European
    Commission.
</p>
<p>
    In order to protect your personal data, the Commission has put in place a
    number of technical and organisational measures. Technical measures include
    appropriate actions to address online security, risk of data loss,
    alteration of data or unauthorised access, taking into consideration the
    risk presented by the processing and the nature of the personal data being
    processed. Organisational measures include restricting access to the
    personal data solely to authorised persons with a legitimate need to know
    for the purposes of the processing operations.
</p>
<p>
    The security of your personal data is important to us but remember that no
    method of transmission over the Internet, or method of electronic storage,
    is 100% secure. While we strive to use means to protect your personal data,
    we cannot guarantee its absolute security.

<h1>
    <a name="_Toc30690374">
        6. WHO HAS ACCESS TO YOUR PERSONAL DATA AND TO WHOM IS IT DISCLOSED?
