			<h2>
				What is EUSurvey?
			</h2>
			<p>
				EUSurvey is an online survey management tool to create, publish and manage questionnaires and other
				interactive forms in most web browsers.
			</p>
			<h2>
				When do I use EUSurvey?
			</h2>
			<p>
				Use EUSurvey whenever you want to make a questionnaire or interactive form accessible online, or to
				record a large number of similar datasets.
			</p>
			<h2>
				What are the limits of EUSurvey?
			</h2>
			<p>
				Please open the <a href="https://ec.europa.eu/eusurvey/home/documentation">Support</a> page to find the
				'Usability limits' of the tool.
			</p>
			<p>
				EUSurvey may not be the right tool for your project if:
				<ul>
					<li>
						different participants need to work on the same contribution before it is submitted
					</li>
					<li>
						contributions need to be validated before they can be submitted
					</li>
				</ul>
			</p>
			<p>
				Please contact DIGIT-EUSURVEY-SUPPORT for additional information, upcoming features and possible
				workarounds.
			</p>
			<h2>
				What are the features of EUSurvey?
			</h2>
			<p>
				<strong>Customizable forms</strong>
				<br/>
				In the easy-to-use editor you can choose from a variety of question types; from simple text and
				multiple-choice questions to spreadsheet questions or multimedia survey elements. Structure your survey
				using special structural elements.
			</p>
			<p>
				<strong>Dependent questions</strong>
				<br/>
				EUSurvey can display additional questions and fields, depending on the answers given by the participant,
				making the survey interactive.
			</p>
			<p>
				<strong>Scheduled publishing</strong>
				<br/>
				Publish and unpublish your survey automatically at a specified point in time.
			</p>
			<p>
				<strong>Modify your form after publication</strong>
				<br/>
				You can modify a published survey without losing any contributions.
			</p>
			<p>
				<strong>Languages</strong>
				<br/>
				The user interface is available in 23 of the official EU languages, and you can translate your form into
				any of the 136 languages covered by ISO 639-1, from Abkhaz to Zulu.
			</p>
			<p>
				<strong>Security</strong>
				<br/>
				EUSurvey has the infrastructure needed to secure the online forms.
			</p>
			<p>
				<strong>Sending out invitations directly from the application</strong>
				<br/>
				Selected contacts can be managed in the 'Address Book' and used to send out individual emails to every
				single contact containing individual access links.
			</p>
			<p>
				<strong>Advanced privacy</strong>
				<br/>
				You can guarantee the participant's privacy by creating an anonymous form. Connection details will then
				not be available to you as the author of the form.
			</p>
			<p>
				<strong>Customise the look and feel</strong>
				<br/>
				With the built-in CSS style editor and embedded rich-text editors for all visible elements, you have
				full control over the form's layout. A large list of survey themes makes it easy to adapt the form to a
				project's identity. You can choose between single page and multi-page surveys
			</p>
			<p>
				<strong>Save a contribution as draft</strong>
				<br/>
				You can allow participants to save their contribution as a draft on the server and continue later.
			</p>
			<p>
				<strong>Offline answering</strong>
				<br/>
				With EUSurvey, you can answer a form offline before submitting a contribution to the server at a later
				point in time.
			</p>
			<p>
				<strong>Automatic numbering</strong>
				<br/>
				To structure your survey, EUSurvey can number your form's elements for you.
			</p>
			<p>
				<strong>Enhanced contrast</strong>
				<br/>
				Visually impaired participants can choose a high-contrast version of the survey. This is created
				automatically for each form.
			</p>
			<p>
				<strong>Uploading supporting files</strong>
				<br/>
				You can add files to your survey by uploading them. These files can be downloaded by every participant
				in your survey.
			</p>
			<h2>
				Form management
			</h2>
			<p>
				<strong>Working together</strong>
				<br/>
				For surveys that are managed by multiple users, EUSurvey lets you define advanced permissions for other
				users to test a survey or to analyse the results.
			</p>
			<h2>
				Result management
			</h2>
			<p>
				<strong>Analysing your results</strong>
				<br/>
				EUSurvey offers basic result analysis capabilities and visualization of data in histograms and chart
				views. You can also export survey results to standard spreadsheet formats in order to import them into
				statistical applications.
			</p>
			<p>
				<strong>Publishing your results</strong>
				<br/>
				Use the possibilities EUSurvey offers to publish a sub-set of all submitted answers on the internal
				pages of the application. Statistics and charts can be calculated and created automatically by the
				system.
			</p>
			<p>
				<strong>Editing submitted contributions</strong>
				<br/>
				Let your participants modify a contribution after it has been submitted, if they want to.
			</p>

			<p>
				The editor consists of five different areas:
				<ol type="i">
					<li>
						<strong>Navigation pane:</strong>
						<br/>
						The Navigation pane provides a structured view of the questionnaire. All elements are
						represented by their respective text label in the questionnaire. When you select an element in
						the Navigation pane, the Form area jumps to the selected item which is then highlighted in blue.
					</li>
					<li>
						<strong>Toolbox pane:</strong>
						<br/>
						The Toolbox pane contains all the element types that you can add to your questionnaire.
						You can add elements either by using the drag-and-drop feature or by double-clicking them.
					</li>

			</p>
			<p>
				In the editor you will find a Toolbox of available elements on the left and the Form area in the middle
				of the screen. The elements contain default texts, with the name of the element displayed as the
				question text. To add a new element (question, text field, image, etc.), select one from the Toolbox.
				You can add elements either by using the drag-and-drop feature or by double-clicking them.

					'How do I create a questionnaire via the EUSurvey editor?'
				</a>
				)
			</p>
			<p>
				By default, all elements are set to always visible, which means that everybody will see the question
				when answering the survey.
			</p>
			<p>
				To create a dependent question:
				<ol>
					<li>Add a single/multiple choice or matrix question to your questionnaire.</li>
					<li>Add further elements to your questionnaire.</li>
					<li>Select an element that follows a single/multiple choice or matrix element and that should only
						appear when a specific answer has been chosen.</li>
					<li>Click the pen icon to edit the visibility settings. All available questions of the type single
						choice, multiple choice and matrix that are placed above the selected element(s) are displayed,
						including the question text and the possible answers.</li>
					<li>Select the answer that, when chosen, will display the selected element.</li>
					<li>Click 'Apply' to confirm the visibility setting.</li>
				</ol>
			</p>
			<p>
				If multiple elements are selected, you can edit the visibility settings for all of them at once.
			</p>
			<p>
				<strong>Note:</strong> This modification will only affect the questionnaire on the Test page and in
				published mode. All elements will still be visible in the editor.
			</p>
			<p>
				When activated, arrows are displayed next to the connected elements to visualise the visibility settings
				in the Form area. Answers that trigger any element are displayed with an arrow pointing down. Elements
				that are triggered by any answer are marked with an arrow pointing up.
			</p>
			<p>
				When moving the pointer over the arrows or IDs in the Element properties pane, the connected elements
				are highlighted in the Form area and Navigation pane.
			</p>			
			<p>
				Elements with visibility settings that have been edited will be hidden in the questionnaire until at
				least one of the configured answers has been selected by the participant when filling in the questionnaire.
			</p>
			<h2>
				Can I generate the order of answers in a single or multiple choice question?
			</h2>
			<p>
				When creating a single or multiple choice question, you will have the option to generate their answers
				in three different ways:
				<ul>
					<li>
						Original Order
					</li>
					<li>
						Alphabetical Order
					</li>
					<li>
						Random Order
					</li>
				</ul>
			</p>
			<p>
				Original Order: This option will display the original order of your answers on the survey.
			</p>
			<p>
				Alphabetical Order: You can select this option if the answers should be displayed alphabetically on the
				survey.
			</p>
			<p>
				Random Order: You can choose this option if the answers should be randomly displayed on the survey.
			</p>
			<h2>
				How do I give other users permission to edit my survey?
			</h2>
			<p>
				Open your survey and open the 'Privileges' page. Click on 'Add new user' or 'Add department'. A wizard
				will pop up that guides you through the process of adding users. Next you can give them specific access
				rights. Simply click on the colour to change the rights.
			</p>
			<p>
				<ul>
					<li>
						Green: Read and Write access
					</li>
					<li>
						Yellow: Read access
					</li>
					<li>
						Red: No access
					</li>
				</ul>
			</p>
			<p>
				Added users will automatically see your survey in their list of surveys next time they log into EUSurvey.
			</p>
			<p>
				External owners or survey organizers cannot see EU domains on the Privileges tab / Add users button,
				therefore, they cannot provide access for these persons directly. Please

			<h2>
				Which languages are supported by the application?
			</h2>
			<p>
				Languages which can be encoded in '3byte UTF-8' can be used to create a	survey.
			</p>
			<h2>
				So why UTF-8 and which fonts should be used?
			</h2>
			<p>
				Keep in mind that the target group of participants can display the survey easily if the font you used
				is installed in their browser. UTF-8 is the most common encoding for the HTML pages.
				On the other hand, choosing non-supported fonts may affect the rendering of PDF export.
			</p>
			<p>
				We recommend using the <strong>supported character sets</strong> listed below:
			</p>
			<ul>
				<li>
					Freesans (

			<p>
				<strong>'Freesans' is the default font used</strong>

			<p>
				In case of doubt, run a PDF export of your final survey to check
				if your survey is rendered correctly in PDF. Beware however that
				some contributions may not to be rendered correctly in PDF. Your
				participants, indeed, are free to choose any font among those which
				are supported by the application. Even though the application is
				unable to render the characters they have used, these are saved
				correctly on the EUSurvey's database. Thus they can be exported from
				the results page.
			</p>
			<h2>
				Complexity indicator  
			</h2>
			<p>
				Keeping your survey short and simple will ease the filling of your survey by the respondents and lead to a better user experience. Of course, sometimes you need to add branch logic using dependencies (i.e. dependent questions that are hidden/displayed depending on the previous answers given). This is fine, but please bear in mind that adding too many items or dependencies to your survey makes it too 'complex'. This can lead to the system slowing down for participants when filling out your questionnaire.
			</p>
			<p>
				This is why there is a little indicator at the top-right corner of the form editor:<br />
				<img src="${contextpath}/resources/images/documentation/complexity.png" />
			</p>
			<p>
				Your survey could have a high level of complexity for several reasons: 
				<ul>
					<li>too many dependencies</li>
					<li>too many cascading dependencies</li>
					<li>too many table/matrix items</li>
				</ul>
			</p>

			<h1>
				Survey security
			</h1>
			<h2>
				How do I restrict access to my survey?    
			</h2>
			<p>
				By default, an EUSurvey online form is publicly available as soon as it has been published. You can
				change this and allow only privileged users to access the survey by setting the survey to
				<strong>'Secured'</strong> in the 'Security settings' on the 'Properties' page. You can then allow
				access to your privileged users by either:
			</p>
			<ul>
				<li>
					Inviting your participants with the EUSurvey invitation module (see '
					<a href="#_Toc_13_0">
						Inviting participants
					</a>
					'). Each participant will get a unique access link. OR
				</li>
				<li>
					Securing your survey by EU Login. In the 'Properties' page enable the options 'Secure your survey'
					and 'Secure with EU Login'. If you are a member of an EU body, you can choose either to allow all
					users with an EU Login account (members of the EU institutions and external EU Login accounts) to
					access your survey, or to grant access only to members of the EU institutions. OR
				</li>
				<li>
					Setting up a password. This will be the same for all participants and you will have to communicate
					it to your audience. Practically, you will send the survey location link and the global password
					(see '
					<a href="#_Toc_5_2">
						How do I set a password for my survey?
					</a>
					').
				</li>
			</ul>
			<h2>
				How do I set a password for my survey?    
			</h2>
			<p>
				To protect your survey with a password, edit the 'Secured with password' option under 'Properties'. To
				invite individual contacts to access your secured survey, please read the Help section '
				<a href="#_Toc_13_0">
					Inviting participants
				</a>
				'.
			</p>
			<h2>
				How do I ensure that an user does not submit more than a defined number of contributions to my survey?
			</h2>
			<p>
				To ensure that an user does not submit more than a defined number of contributions to your survey, in
				the 'Properties' page enable the options 'Secure your survey' and 'Secure with EU Login' and set the
				number in the 'Contributions per user' option.
			</p>
			<h2>
				What do I do to prevent robots from submitting multiple contributions to my survey?
			</h2>
			<p>
				Automatic scripts can falsify the outcome of an online survey by
				submitting a high number of contributions. To prevent this, you can
				use EUSurvey to make participants solve a
				<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CAPTCHA" target="_blank">CAPTCHA</a> challenge
				before submitting a contribution.
			</p>
			<p>
				You can enable/disable the CAPTCHA in the 'Security' settings under 'Properties'.
			</p>
			<p>
				N.B. Although this won't make fraud impossible, it might discourage people from continuing to try to
				falsify survey results.
			</p>
			<h2>
				Can I enable my participants to access their contributions after submission?
			</h2>
			<p>
				Yes! Go to 'Security' at the 'Properties' page and enable 'Allow
				participants to change their contribution' option. Participants need
				to know the contribution-ID that was shown after they submitted
				their contribution. To change contributions after submission,
				participants should go to the EUSurvey homepage <a
					href="https://ec.europa.eu/eusurvey" target="_blank">https://ec.europa.eu/eusurvey</a>.
				Below the 'Register Now!' button is a link to the <a
					href="https://ec.europa.eu/eusurvey/home/editcontribution"
					target="_blank"> access page for individual
					contributions </a>. On this page participants must fill in their
				individual contribution-ID and the system will open their
				contribution. This way they can edit their contribution after it has
				been submitted.
			</p>
			<h1>
				Testing a survey
			</h1>
			<h2>
				Can I see how my survey will behave after it has been published?
			</h2>
			<p>
				Yes. Please open the survey in EUSurvey and click on 'Test'. You will see the current draft of your
				survey, and you can access every feature of the published form. You can save the test as a draft or
				directly submit it as your contribution.
			</p>
			<h2>
				How can my colleagues test my survey before it is published?
			</h2>
			<p>
				The 'Test'-page of your survey can also be tested by your colleagues. To give access to this page, open
				your survey in EUSurvey, go to the 'Privileges' tab and click on 'Add User' or 'Add Department'. A
				wizard will guide you through the process of adding your colleagues. To give them appropriate access
				rights for testing, change the colour of 'Access Form Preview' to 'Green'. Simply click on the colour
				to change the rights.
			</p>
			<p>
				The added users will automatically see the survey in their 'Surveys' page once they log into the EUSurvey
				application. Read more about this under '
				<a href="#_Toc_9_8">
					How do I give other users access to my survey?
				</a>
				'
			</p>

			<h1>
				Translations
			</h1>
			<h2>
				How do I translate a survey?    
			</h2>
			<p>
				EUSurvey offers various ways to make the survey available in multiple languages.
				Important: Be sure to finish editing and testing your survey before
				starting on the translations!
			</p>
			<p>
				Open your survey and go to the 'Translations' page. Click on 'Add
				New Translation'. Select the language from the list of supported
				languages. If the required language does not appear in the list,
				select 'other' and specify a valid two-letter ISO 639-1 language
				code. Click 'OK' to add the empty translation form to your survey.
				Please read '
				<a href="#_Toc_7_3"> Can I edit an existing translation online?
				</a> ' for more information on how to add new labels to your newly
				created translation.
			</p>
			<p>
				Don't forget to select the box 'To Publish' if the translation is to be published along with your survey.
				Once you add a translation for publishing, participants can choose from the available languages directly
				from the survey link.
			</p>
			<h2>
				How can I upload an existing translation to my survey?    
			</h2>
			<p>
				Open your survey and open the 'Translations' page. Click on
				'Upload existing translation'. A wizard will guide you through the
				process of uploading the translation.
			</p>
			<h2>
				Can I edit an existing translation online?    
			</h2>
			<p>
				Yes! Open your survey, go to the 'Translations' page and select
				one or more translations to edit. Select 'Edit Translations' from
				the action menu just above the list of available translations and
				click on the 'OK' button. This will open the online translation
				editor that will allow you to edit multiple translations at a time.
				Please click the 'Save' button to make sure that your changes are
				written to the system.
			</p>
			<p>
				In order to edit only one translation, open your survey, go to the
				'Translations' page and click on the pen icon in the 'Actions'
				column.
			</p>
			<h2>
				Can I create my translations offline?    
			</h2>
			<p>
				Yes! Open your survey, go to the 'Translations' page and export your survey as an XLS, ODS or XML file
				to perform the translation offline. The translation can then be imported back into your survey.
			</p>
			<p>
				The usual workflow is to export a language version with status
				'Complete' and then translate all available text labels into the new
				language. Ensure that the new language code is specified at the
				beginning of the form to ensure that the system recognizes the
				language of your translation. Once the survey has been translated
				offline, click 'Upload existing translation' to add it to the
				system. To ensure that no translation is overwritten by accident,
				you will have to specify the language version you are about to
				upload. For security reasons you can select individual labels to
				replace if you do not want all labels to be taken into account.
			</p>
			<h2>
				How do I publish/unpublish my translations? Why can't I publish this translation? What is an
				'Incomplete' translation?
			</h2>
			<p>
				To publish a survey in multiple languages, open your survey, go to
				the 'Translations' page and tick/untick the individual translations
				you want to publish/unpublish under 'To Publish'. Then change to the
				'Overview' page of your survey to publish your survey. If the survey
				had been published before the translations were added/removed, click
				on 'Apply Changes'.
			</p>
			<p>
				To ensure that no translations with missing text are
				published, you cannot publish translations that have empty labels
				(translations that are not 'Complete'). Please make sure your
				translation has no empty labels by using the online translation
				editor. Look for cells with a red background.
			</p>
			<h2>
				Can I upload a translation in a non-European language?    
			</h2>
			<p>
				The application also supports non-European languages. Select 'Other'
				in the uploading process and introduce a valid two-letter
				<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_ISO_639-1_codes">
					ISO 639-1 </a> language code. It is not possible to select a
				non-European language as the main language of your survey.
			</p>
			<h2>
				What does 'Request Machine Translation' mean?    
			</h2>
			<p>
				EUSurvey can provide automatic translations of your questionnaire by using a <strong>Machine Translation
				(MT)</strong>. The application uses the MT@EC service provided by the European Commission.
			</p>
			<p>
				On the 'Translations' page, there are several ways to request machine translation:
			</p>
			<ul>
				<li>
					When adding a new translation, tick the checkbox 'Request Machine Translation'
					(for a translation of your survey's main language)
				</li>
				<li>
					Click the 'Request Translations' button in the 'Actions' column (for a
					translation of your survey's main language)
				</li>
				<li>
					Select all languages you want to be translated (including at
					least one complete translation). Then select 'Request Translations'
					from the select box below your translations and click 'OK'.
				</li>
			</ul>
			<p>
				The status of the translations will change to 'Requested', until they are
				finished. To see when the status has changed, check the 'Translations' page.
			</p>
			<p>
				Machine translations will behave like other translations you added manually,
				i.e. they will not be published automatically, and adding new elements to your
				survey will make them incomplete (to complete them, you'll have to request
				a new translation).
			</p>

					We cannot guarantee the quality of the resulting text or the delivery
					time for translations.

				Publishing a survey
			</h1>
			<h2>
				How do I publish my survey?
			</h2>
			<p>
				To publish a survey from a current working draft, please go to the 'Overview' page and click on
				'Publish'. After confirmation, the system will automatically create a working copy of your survey
				and put it online, along with the set of translations you have selected for publication on the
				'Translations' page (See '
				<a href="#_Toc_7_5">
					How do I publish/unpublish my translations?
				</a>
				'). You will find the link to your published survey in 'Survey Location' on the 'Overview' page.
			</p>
			<p>
				To unpublish your survey, just click the 'Unpublish' button. The unpublished survey will stay available
				to you in the form in which it was published, along with your current working draft. This means that the
				unpublished survey does not have to be replaced by your current working draft but can be republished if
				necessary.
			</p>
			<h2>
				Can I customise the URL to my survey?    
			</h2>
			<p>
				Yes! By changing your survey's 'Alias' you can make the URL to
				your survey more meaningful. Open the survey and go to the
				'Properties' page. Change your survey's alias under the 'Basic'
				section. An alias can only contain alphanumeric characters and
				hyphens. If you change the alias of a published survey, go to the
				'Overview' page and click on 'Apply Changes'.
			</p>
			<p>
				Please note that aliases have to be unique in EUSurvey. You will get a warning if your alias has already
				been taken by another survey.
			</p>
			<h2>
				Can I link directly to a translation of my survey?    
			</h2>
			<p>
				When you send out invitations containing the link or use the link to the
				published form on the 'Overview' page, by default the link points to the
				form in the main language.
			</p>
			<p>
				You can also<strong> redirect respondents directly</strong> to a specific
				translation by using this link:
			</p>
			<p>
				https://ec.europa.eu/eusurvey/runner/<strong>SurveyAlias</strong>?surveylanguage=<strong>LC</strong>
			</p>
			<p>
				Just replace:
			</p>
			<ul>
				<li>
					<strong>SurveyAlias</strong> with the <strong>alias of your survey</strong>
				</li>
				<li>
					<strong>LC</strong> with the appropriate <strong>ISO 639-1 language code</strong> (e.g. FR for
					French, DE for German, etc.)
				</li>
			</ul>
			<h2>
				How do I make my survey publish itself while I am on holiday?
			</h2>
			<p>
				You can schedule your survey to be published automatically at any
				time. Open the survey and go to the 'Properties' page. Enable the
				'Automatic survey publishing' option under the 'Advanced' section,
				then specify the start- and expiry-date of your survey.
			</p>
			<h2>
				Can I receive a reminder of when my survey will end?    
			</h2>
			<p>
				EUSurvey can send you an email reminder when your survey is about to end. This
				allows you to prepare the next steps (e.g. organising resources for result
				analysis).
			</p>
			<p>
				To enable this option, open the survey and go to the
				'Properties' page. Select 'Advanced Settings' section and, click on
				the 'Edit' button and enable 'End Notification', specifying how long
				in advance you expect an email. Click on 'Save'. The reminder email

			<h2>
				If I discover an error in my survey, can I correct it?    
			</h2>
			<p>
				Yes, you can edit and change the survey as often as you want and
				add or change any additional (dependent) question. However, please
				note that the more changes you make the less usable the collected
				data will be, given that different participants in your survey might
				have responded to different surveys. So, to make sure that you can
				still compare the full set of answers, it is recommended that you
				avoid changing the structure of your survey at all. Please note that
				you are fully responsible for every change you apply to your survey
				during its lifetime.
			</p>
			<p>
				If you do want to change an already published survey, please
				remember to click on 'Apply Changes' on the survey's 'Overview' page
				to make sure the changes are visible in the published survey.

			<h2>
				Will I lose any submitted answers when I change my form?    
			</h2>
			<p>
				No answers are lost, unless you delete your survey from the
				system. However, you might not be able to visualize the full set of
				collected data if you have removed individual questions from your
				survey during the active period of your survey. This is because the
				search mask always represents the most recently published form only.

			<h2>
				How do I give other users access to my survey?
			</h2>
			<p>
				In EUSurvey, you can grant access to other users for different purposes:
			</p>
			<ul>
				<li>
					Testing the survey ('Access Form Preview')
				</li>
				<li>
					Accessing the results ('Results')
				</li>
				<li>
					Editing the survey ('Form Management')
				</li>
			</ul>
			<p>
				In order to provide them access, open your survey and go to the
				'Privileges' page. You can grant access to a person or a department.
				The following access rights are possible:
			</p>
			<p>
				<ul>
					<li>
						Green: Read and write access
					</li>
					<li>
						Yellow: Read access
					</li>
					<li>
						Red: No access
					</li>
				</ul>
			</p>
			<p>
				In order to proceed, please click on 'Add user' or 'Add
				department' on the 'Privileges' page. A window will pop up that
				guides you through the process of adding users.
			</p>
			<p>
				By clicking on 'Add user', you will have to select the correct
				domain (i.e. European Commission), then enter the login, E-mail
				address or any other field and click on 'Search'. Then select the
				user and click on 'Ok'.
			</p>
			<p>
				By selecting 'Add department', select the correct domain and
				navigate to the right department. Then click on 'Ok'.
			</p>
			<p>
				External owners or survey organizers cannot see EU domains on
				the Privileges tab / Add users button, therefore, they cannot
				provide access for these persons directly. Please contact us to
				request privileges for external users.
			</p>
			<p>
				You will then be redirected to the 'Privileges' page where you
				can set the right permissions by clicking on the red icons:
			</p>
			<ul>
				<li>
					To grant the right to test your survey:<br> Change the colour of
					'Access Form Preview' to 'Green'. Simply click on the colour to
					change the rights. The added users will automatically see the
					survey in their 'Surveys' page once they log in to the EUSurvey
					application (see also '<a href="#_Toc_6_2"> How can my
						colleagues test my survey before it is published? </a> ').
				</li>
				<li>
					To grant the right to access the results of your survey:<br>
					Change the colour of 'Results' to 'Yellow'. The users can only view
					the results, but cannot edit or delete anything. If you change the
					colour to 'Green', they can view, edit and delete the answers (see
					also '<a href="#_Toc_10_7"> How do I give other users access
						to my survey's results? </a> ').
				</li>
				<li>
					To grant the right to edit your survey:<br> By changing the

					survey. But if you select 'Green', they can also edit it. They
					will automatically see your survey in their list of surveys (see
					also ' <a href="#_Toc_4_11"> How do I give other users
						permission to edit my survey? </a> ').
				</li>
				<li>
					To grant the access right to manage invitations of your
					survey:<br> By changing the colour to 'Yellow', the privileged users
					can only view your invitations. But if you select 'Green', they
					can also edit it. They will automatically see your survey in their
					list of surveys (see also '<a href="#_Toc_4_11"> How do I give
						other users permission to edit my survey? </a> ').
				</li>
			</ul>
			<p>
				If you set all 4 circles to 'Green', the privileged user will
				have full rights permission to your survey.
			</p>
			<h2>
				What are Activity logs?
			</h2>
			<p>
				Activity logs monitor and log the activity on your survey. This way,
				you can check which user applied which change to your survey and at
				what time. You can also export the activity logs into several file
				formats such as xls, csv and ods. Enter the activity log of your
				survey by clicking on the 'Activity' page, next to 'Properties'. If
				the activity logs are empty, it may be that they are deactivated
				system-wide. Find <a

			</h2>
			<p>
				To export submitted answers from EUSurvey to your computer,
				open your survey and go to the 'Results' page. Click on the
				'Export' button in the top right-hand corner of the page, select
				from the available export file formats and specify a name in the
				dialogue box. Under this name the export file will appear on the
				'Export' page. Different export file formats are available,
				depending on the view mode (Full Content/ Statistics). N.B. The
				export file will contain the set of configured questions only as
				well as the current search results of a filter process.
			</p>
			<h2>
				How can I extract the Draft answers?
			</h2>
			<p>
				On your Dashboard you can see the number of the saved Draft
				contributions for your survey. Your participants have the option to
				save their work as a Draft and continue the filling in a later time.
				According with our privacy policy, as a form manager you are not
				allowed to extract the Draft answers.
			</p>
			<h2>
				How can I access and analyse a defined subset of all contributions?
			</h2>
			<p>
				On the 'Results' page (see '<a href="#_Toc_10_1"> Where can I
					find the contributions submitted by my respondents? </a>') search for
				keywords in free-text answers or select individual answers from
				choice-questions in the filter bar. This limits the full set of
				answers to a subset of contributions. For performance reasons you
				can only set a maximum of 3 filters! At any point you can change the
				view mode, so you can carry out an advanced statistical analysis of
				the data collected. Note: to view and analyse results, you need
				certain privileges (see '<a href="#_Toc_10_7"> How do I give
					other users access to the results of my survey? </a>'). To export a
				subset of contributions, please read '<a href="#_Toc_10_2">How
					can I download submitted contributions?</a>'.
			</p>
			<h2>
				How can I get back to the full set of answers, after
				defining a subset of contributions?

			<p>
				To visualize the full set of answers, click the 'Reset' button
				at the top of the 'Results' page or deactivate every search you've
				performed on the filter-bar on this page.
			</p>
			<h2>
				How can I publish my results?
			</h2>
			<p>
				Open the survey, go to the 'Properties' page and select
				'Publish Results' section. Here you will find the URL of the
				published results and will be able to choose which
				questions/answers/contributions you would like to publish. You can
				also go there directly by clicking on 'Edit Results Publication'
				from the 'Overview' page of your survey.
			</p>
			<p>
				Please be sure to select something in 'Publish Results'
				under 'Publish', otherwise the system will not publish any
				results.
			</p>
			<h2>
				How can I access the published results?
			</h2>
			<p>
				Open the 'Overview' page and click on the 'Published'
				hyperlink right next to the word 'Results'. This will direct you
				to the published results. Everybody who knows this address can
				access your results.
			</p>
			<h2>
				How do I give other users access to the results of my survey?
			</h2>
			<p>
				Open your survey, go to the 'Privileges' page and give results
				access to other users. Read more about this under '<a
					href="#_Toc_10_7"> How do I give other users access to my
					survey? </a>'.
			</p>
			<h2>
				I cannot unzip my exported files
			</h2>
			<p>
				This might happen if the name of the files contained in your
				folder is too long. Windows has a maximum length of 260 characters
				for directory locations on the hard drive. Possible solutions for
				this are:
			</p>
			<ul>
				<li>
					Unzip the folder in the root directory of your operating system, e.g.
					unpack at 'C:' instead of 'C:\Users\USERNAME\Desktop'
				</li>
				<li>
					Or when unpacking the files, rename the target folder to shorten the
					directory length.
				</li>
			</ul>
			<h2>
				Published results - protection of personal information uploaded by participants
			</h2>
			<p>
				For data protection rules, the form manager has to actively
				make the choice to publish files uploaded to a contribution by the
				participant along with the other results. To do so, tick the
				'Uploaded elements' check box in the corresponding section on the
				'Properties' page under 'Publish Results' section. Please note that
				this check box will only appear if your survey contains an 'uploaded
				element'.
			</p>
			<h2>
				How do I design a survey to publish the results with or without personal information?

				Managing contacts and invitations
			</h1>
			<h2>
				What is the 'Address Book'?    
			</h2>
			<p>
				In the 'Address Book' you can create your own groups of participants.
				This way you can invite people or organisations who match certain criteria
				(e.g. 'male', and 'older than 21').	Every potential participant is stored
				as a contact in the address book along with an unlimited list of editable
				attributes. You can save any contact to your address book as long as they
				have an identifier ('Name') and an email address.
			<h2>
				What are the 'Attributes' of a contact?
			</h2>
			<p>
				Each contact saved in the address book has a variable set of attributes
				such as 'Country', 'Phone', 'Remarks', etc. You can create a new attribute
				by editing a contact.
			</p>
			<p>
				<ol>
					<li>
						In the 'Edit Contact' window, open the 'attributes' menu and select 'New...'.
					</li>
					<li>
						A new window will pop up where you can define the name of the new attribute.
					</li>
					<li>
						The newly created attribute will appear as a column in the address book
						and can also be added to a set of contacts.
					</li>
				</ol>
			</p>
			<h2>
				How do I add new contacts to my address book?    
			</h2>
			<p>
				Go to the 'Address Book' page and click on 'Add Contact' to add a single contact.
				You can click on 'Import' to upload an existing list of contacts in XLS,
				ODS, CSV or TXT format.
			</p>
			<p>
				See also '
				<a href="#_Toc_12_5">

				</a>
				'
			</p>
			<h2>
				What is a 'Registration Form'?    
			</h2>
			<p>
				A registration form can be understood as a survey that automatically creates
				contacts from the personal data that participants submit.
			</p>
			<p>
				To enable this feature:
			</p>
			<p>
				<ol>
					<li>
						Open your survey.
					</li>
					<li>
						Go to the 'Properties' page and select 'Advanced'.
					</li>
					<li>
						Enable 'Create Contacts' and click 'Save'.
					</li>
				</ol>
			</p>
			<p>
				When this is selected, the system inserts 2 compulsory free-text questions
				('Name' and 'Email') to ensure that every participant enters valid personal
				data.
			</p>
			<p>
				By enabling the 'Attribute' option for individual questions, you can
				choose what other information is stored about the newly created contact
				(e.g. a text-question with the attribute 'Telephone' can be used to store
				the participant's phone number in the address book).
			</p>
			<h2>
				How do I import multiple contacts from a file to my address book?    
			</h2>
			<p>
				To import a list of contacts into the system, EUSurvey offers a wizard that
				guides you through the import procedure.

			<p>
				The following file formats are supported:
			</p>
			<ul>
				<li>
					XLS
				</li>
				<li>
					ODS
				</li>
				<li>
					CSV
				</li>
				<li>

					</li>
					<li>
						Specify the type of separator you used for CSV and TXT files (the
						most probable character is suggested by default).
					</li>
				</ol>
			</p>
			<p>
				As a second step:
			</p>
			<p>
				<ol>
					<li>
						The system will ask you to map the individual columns to new attributes
						for your contacts (the mandatory attributes 'Name' and 'Email' must be
						mapped in order to proceed).
					</li>
					<li>
						Once you click 'Next', the system loads your file into the system,
						displaying the individual contacts that will be imported.
						You can unselect individual contacts you don't want to import
					</li>
					<li>
						Click 'Save' to save your contacts to your address book.
					</li>
				</ol>
			</p>
			<h2>
				How do I edit an attribute for multiple contacts at a time?    
			</h2>
			<p>

						Search and select the contacts in your address book.
					</li>
					<li>
						Select 'Bulk Edit' and click 'OK'.

				the client and the server.
			</p>
			<p>
				Therefore, the user's browser must be configured to accept 'cookies', which
				disappear once the session has been terminated.
			</p>
			<p>
				The system uses local storage to save copies of the participant's input to a
				survey. This is to ensure there is a backup if the server is not available
				during submission, the user's computer is switched off accidentally, etc.
			</p>
			<p>
				The local storage contains the IDs of the questions and the draft answers.
			</p>
			<p>
				Once a participant has submitted their answers to the server or has saved a
				draft on the server, the data is removed from the local storage.
			</p>
			<p>
				There is a checkbox above the survey - 'Save a backup on your local
				computer (disable if you are using a public/shared computer)' - to disable
				this feature. In that case, no data will be stored on the used computer.

			<h2>
				What information is stored by EUSurvey when participants submit a
				contribution?
			</h2>
			<p>
				The information that is saved by EUSurvey depends on the security
				settings of your survey as well as on the method you use to invite
				your participants to contribute to your survey.
			</p>
			<p>
				<strong>Publicly accessible open survey:</strong>
			</p>
			<p>
				By default, if your survey is <strong>not secured</strong>, EUSurvey does <strong>not save any user-related information</strong>.
			</p>
			<p>
				However, the IP of every connection is saved for security reasons for every
				server request (see
				<a
						href="https://ec.europa.eu/eusurvey/home/privacystatement"
						target="_blank"
						>
					privacy statement on the protection of personal data
				</a>
				).
			</p>
			<p>
				<strong>Survey secured with a password:</strong>
			</p>
			<p>
				If your survey is secured by a <strong>password only</strong>, EUSurvey
				does <strong>not save</strong> any user-related information.
			</p>
			<p>
				However, the IP of every connection is saved for security reasons for every
				server request (see
				<a
						href="https://ec.europa.eu/eusurvey/home/privacystatement"
						target="_blank"
						>
					privacy statement on the protection of personal data
				</a>
				).
			</p>
			<p>
				<strong>Survey secured with EU Login authentication:</strong>
			</p>
			<p>
				If your survey is secured by <strong>EU Login authentication</strong>,
				EUSurvey will <strong>save</strong> the email address of the EU Login
				account.
			</p>
			<p>
				In addition, the IP of every connection is saved for security reasons for every
				server request (see
				<a
						href="https://ec.europa.eu/eusurvey/home/privacystatement"
						target="_blank"
						>
					privacy statement on the protection of personal data
				</a>
				).
			</p>
			<p>
				<strong>Sending invitations using EUSurvey:</strong>
			</p>
			<p>
				If you use EUSurvey to send invitations to your participants on a
				guest list on the 'Participants' page, it will send
				<strong>an unique invitation link</strong> to each participant.
			</p>
			<p>
				On submission, EUSurvey will save an invitation number that can be used
				<strong>to match</strong> the invited participant with the submitted
				contributions. This action is independent from your survey's security
				settings.
			</p>
			<p>
				Furthermore, the IP of every connection is saved for security reasons for
				every server request (see
				<a
						href="https://ec.europa.eu/eusurvey/home/privacystatement"
						target="_blank"
						>
					privacy statement on the protection of personal data
				</a>
				).
			</p>
			<p>
				<strong>Creating an anonymous survey:</strong>
			</p>
			<p>
				You can choose to create an anonymous survey by using the 'Anonymous survey mode'
				option in the survey properties. If activated, contributions to your survey will
				be anonymous as EUSurvey will not save any personal data such as IP addresses.
				If you want your survey to be fully anonymous, do not include questions
				collecting personal data in your survey design.

			<h2>
				Do I need to include a privacy statement?    
			</h2>
			<p>
				This depends on the questions you ask and the type of data you collect from
				your survey.
			</p>
			<p>
				Please note that your participants may not want to take part if you cannot
				guarantee the confidentiality of the data submitted.
			</p>
			<p>
				<strong>For EU staff only:</strong>

				If personal data is collected, a privacy statement must be drafted and then published together with the questionnaire. 
			</p>
			<p>
				Please contact the DPC (Data Protection Coordinator) of your DG in order to validate the privacy statement. 
			</p>
			<p>
				Additionally, any collection of personal data must be notified to the Data Protection Officer (DPO). Please contact your DPC if you need assistance for notification to the DPO.
